# EkeVim

This project has been created as an attempt to move my neovim setup to NixVim.

It's built upon the template generated by following command:

`nix flake init --template github:nix-community/nixvim`

## Configuring

To start configuring, just add or modify the nix files in `./config`.
If you add a new configuration file, remember to add it to the
[`config/default.nix`](./config/default.nix) file

## Testing your new configuration

To test your configuration simply run the following command

```
nix run . -- <neovim arguments>
```
